        <h1>Basics</h1>
        <p>Now that we have talked a little bit about how Node.JS works underneath the covers, and how to write hello world. Let's continue this tutorial by actually creating a Node.JS web app.</p>
        <h3>Basic Web Server</h3>
        <p>First let's look at a brief example:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
var http = require("http");

var server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {

   // Send the HTTP header 
   //Sending a response code of OK with plain text Content Type
   response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
   
   response.end('This is the content of the web page\n');
});
server.listen();

// Console will print the port
console.log('Server is listening on port 1234');
            </code>
        </pre>
        
        <p>Lets break this code down line by line. The first line </p><code>var http = requre("http");</code> <p>is essentially an import statement. It is including that the program uses the http module. We will talk about this more in the next section but for now just think of it as a collection of related code. Once we imported the http module we can set up an event listener for http requests.</p>
        
        <pre> <code>
var server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {

// Send the HTTP header 
//Sending a response code of OK with plain text Content Type
response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
   
response.end('This is the content of the web page\n');
});
        </code></pre>
        <p>This code is creating a variable server that is essentially an event handler that will call the anonymous callback function anytime there is a http request. The call back function writes the http header to be a return status of OK and says the type is plain text. The last thing is it sends the html body. Normally, this is where you load if from a file or generate it on the fly but whatever you send here the clients browser will parse as html.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>The next line </p> <code>server.listen()</code> tells the Node.JS event queue that you are subscribing the servers handler. Any http request will now be processed. If you leave this line out the event handler will never get registered, and as we explained before the program will exit because the event handler has no handlers to process events.</p>
    
        <br>
        <p>Once the handler is registered then the console prints to the command line the port it is listening on: </p><code>console.log('Server is listening on port 1234');</code> <p> The main.js returns back to the environment which then proceeds to execute the event queue. Until the program is killed our Node.JS app will continue to process web requests always answering the content.</p>
    
    <br>
    <p>To give this a try save the above code as main.js and execute it by running node main.js. Then open your browser and go to the url: localhost:1234 and watch our basic application.</p>
    
    <h3>Event Handlers and Emitters</h3>
    <p>As we mentioned a thousand times before Node.JS is an event based framework. This means that there are three major pieces. The Events, Event Handlers, and the Event Emitters. We have already talked about how the event loop sits there and waits for events to get put on its queue and then processes them. However, we haven't mentioned how the events get put on that queue in the first place. These things that generate events are called event emitters. Lets talk about the main event emitter, the OS. </p>
    
    <h4>The OS</h4>
    <p>The easiest way to get your head around event emitters to first talk about the one that already exists, the OS. The os sends out signals and the application can handle them and put them on the queue. Going back to our c++ example from the previous slide, we might do something like.</p>
    
            <pre>
            <code>
            
BlockingQueue *queue;

void catchSigInt(int signum){
    if( queue != Null){
        Event *e = new QuitEvent();
        queue.push(e);
    }
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
                
    std::vector&ltHandler&gt handlers;
    *queue = new BlockingQueue();
      
    //Set up the handlers
    
    //Set up the emiters
    signal(SIGINT, catchSigInt);
    
    while(shouldRun){
        Event e = queue.pop(); //Blocks until there is an event to process
                    
        for(std::vector&ltHandler&gt::iterator it = handlers.begin(); it != handlers.end(); ++it){
            *it.handle(event); //Only call handle if the handler is subscribed to the certain event
        }
    }
}

            </code>
        </pre>
    
        <p>Hopefully this seems pretty straight forward. When the os has something to report the signal handlers generate an event object and push it onto the queue. This is exactly what happens with our server example above. When the os wakes up our program with the socket read from the http request. An event gets generated and pushed onto the queue. Our server handler wakes up and then handles that event. This process is so efficient and easy that this has become the fundamental for all event based systems.</p>
    
    <h4>Node.JS event Emitters</h4>
    <p>You may be asking, Why do I care about the OS event emitter is Node.JS handles everything for me? Well the answer is easy. With Node.JS we are able to create our own event emitters. In order to do this we need to introduce a new module, the events module. The events module is used just like the http module. Once we require it we are free to use all of its features. The one were after is called the event emitter and we can create one just like.</p>
    <pre> <code>
//Require the module
var events = require("events");

//Create the event emiter
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmmitter();

    </code></pre>
    
    <p>That's all it takes to create an event emitter but emitting events becomes pretty useless if you don't have a handler to process them. What we need to do is to create an event handler with a callback and then bind it to the event type. To do this we can add to our code.</p>
        <pre> <code>
//Require the module
var events = require("events");

//Create the event emiter
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmmitter();

//Create the handler
var ourhandler = function handle(){
    console.log('we need to handle the event');
}

//Now we need to bind the connection
eventEmitter.on('event', ourhandler);

    </code></pre>
    
    <p>The final step is to them emit the event. We can tie it all together now with emitting the event. </p>
    
            <pre> <code>
//Require the module
var events = require("events");

//Create the event emitter
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();

//Create the handler
var ourhandler = function handle(){
    console.log('we need to handle the event');
}

//Now we need to bind the connection
eventEmitter.on('event', ourhandler);

//fire the event
eventEmitter.emit('event');

    </code></pre>
    
    <p>That is all it takes to set up event emitters and event handlers in Node.JS. You can test this code by copying into a file called main.js and running node main.js and testing the output. The events module provides events like this in a synchronous way using the observer design pattern.</p>
