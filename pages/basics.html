        <h3>Android Framework </h3>
        <p>Android is an event based framework that queues up events similar to other event frameworks. Android provides call backs for these different events allowing different objects to be notified when certain events occure. Android apps are native apps and thus are tied very closley with the android operating system. The operating system gets events such as touches, networking data received, as well as communication from other processes and queues them up for the app to process. </p>
        
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>Android is built around the concept of a context. A context is a way to represent the current application environment. We will talk a little more about these later but the important part is to understand what they are. Essentially, anytime the app needs to interact with the environment, things like the filesystem or screen, then you need a context in which to interact. The root context is the application context which is held by the application singleton. However each activity and service also holds on the context as well.</p>
        
        <h3>Event Loop</h3>
        <p>We have mentioned several times that the android framework has an event loop. If your not familier with the concept the idea is that the operating system will queue up events and then the main thread will process them. Events can be a list of things but mainly they are things related to the android lifecycle, more on this later, and user actions. For example when the user presses a button an touch event will get triggered and the approptiate callback will get called on the view that it happened on. Another great example is when the phone gets low battery. A low battery event will get triggered and the application will process it.</p>
        
        <p>Now that we have started with some basic android lets talk about the three main important pieces of an android application.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>1.) Application</h3>
        <p>The application object holds a lot of power. Not only does it control the event loop and acts as the root of the application but because it is a singleton you are able to access it from anywhere. This is normally where developers store the state of the application because it gives the rest of the application access to it. Many people overload the default applicatoin object by subclassing it and overriding its members. This is a basic stub of the application object that you would need to overload. Many of the members you can leave but the nice thing is that the event loop will call each one of these methods on different events. </p>
        
<pre><code>
public class OurApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
    }

    @Override
    public void onTerminate() {
        super.onTerminate();
    }

    @Override
    public void onTrimMemory(int level) {
        super.onTrimMemory(level);
    }

    @Override
    public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) {
        super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);
    }

    @Override
    public void onLowMemory() {
        super.onLowMemory();
    }

    public OurApplication() {
        super();
    }

    @Override
    public void registerComponentCallbacks(ComponentCallbacks callback) {
        super.registerComponentCallbacks(callback);
    }

    @Override
    public void unregisterComponentCallbacks(ComponentCallbacks callback) {
        super.unregisterComponentCallbacks(callback);
    }

    @Override
    public void registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(ActivityLifecycleCallbacks callback) {
        super.registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(callback);
    }

    @Override
    public void registerOnProvideAssistDataListener(OnProvideAssistDataListener callback) {
        super.registerOnProvideAssistDataListener(callback);
    }

    @Override
    public void unregisterOnProvideAssistDataListener(OnProvideAssistDataListener callback) {
        super.unregisterOnProvideAssistDataListener(callback);
    }

    @Override
    public void unregisterActivityLifecycleCallbacks(ActivityLifecycleCallbacks callback) {
        super.unregisterActivityLifecycleCallbacks(callback);
    }
}

        <p>The application object is where all events trickle down from so it has access to all the possible call backs. Many applications though only have a gui and thus putting information in the application object become a little overkill. The solution to this is activities.</p>

        <h3>2.) Activities</h3>
