    <h1>Activities</h1>

    <p>
    In Android, there is a concept called "activities." An activity is essentially a screen in your
    current application. The reason it is called an activity is because it is supposed to represent
    a wholly contained activity the user can preform on a system.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each activity in Android must implement an <pre>onCreate</pre> function which is called when
    the activity is initialized. This call should do a number of important things, not least of which
    is setting the content view with the <pre>setContentView</pre> function. This will give the activity
    a "face" of sorts since it loads all the viewable content onto the page.
