    <h1>Activities</h1>

    <p>
    All programs there is a need for an entry point. In C/C++ there's a function called <pre>main</pre>. In Java,
    there are classes that have a static <pre>main</pre>. A similar concept exists in Android called "Activities."
    An activity is essentially a screen in your current application. The theory is that each activity represents
    its own logically separate activity in a program, such as selecting a destination in a navigation app or inputing
    parameters into a fitness App.
    </p>

    <p> In every Andorid application, there is a "Main Activity." This is the
    activity that launches upon startup. It is the initial screen of the
    application, whether the initial screen is actually functional or if the
    screen is just an initial splash screen.  </p>

    <p> Each activity in Android must implement an <pre>onCreate</pre> function
    which is called when the activity is initialized. This call should do a
    number of important things, not least of which is setting the content view
    with the <pre>setContentView</pre> function. This will give the activity a
    "face" of sorts since it loads all the viewable content onto the page. In
    addition on the <pre>onCreate</pre> function, Android also allows the user
    to override some other methods. These include <pre>onPause</pre>, which is
    called once the activity is suspended into the background; the
    <pre>onDestroy</pre> method, called right before the application is
    destroyed (killed) by the user; the <pre>onResume</pre> method, which is
    called after coming out of the pause state; the <pre>onStart</pre> method
    is called at the beginning of the application's life and its counter
    <pre>onStop</pre> is called at the end of the application's life cycle.
    </p>

    <p> A single app may contain more than a single activity. Indeed, a single
    app can contain many different activities.  These activities may be
    switched between by use of the Android intent system. The intent system is
    the way an application talks to the Dalvik virtual machine, and if the
    request is to change an activity, then the virtual machine will then switch
    the screen to the correct screen.  </p>

    <p>
    Often in an application, we don't actually want more than a couple activities. This is because we want to keep an
    overall activity for the user to interact with, but just have dialogs and different sub components to the application.
    In this case, Android employs a concept called "fragments."
    </p>


    <h1>Fragments</h1>

    <p>
    Fragments are related to Activities, but are not the same. Fragments
    are like activities in that a fragment is a part of the user interface that
    the user can interact with, but unlike an activity, they are not standalone
    and must always be a part of an activity. In this sense, an Activity contanis
    a Fragment, but not the other way around.
    </p>

    <p>
    The callbacks that one may override in the <pre>Fragment</pre> class are
    the same as those for an Activity.
    </p>

    <p>
    One of the best features of a Fragments is that they allow the application
    to dynamically remove and add them to certain activities. This allows for
    the application to be written in a dynamic matter rather than a static manner.
    </p>

    <p>
    Fragments also allow a single "widget" to be created and also appear in multiple
    different parts of the application. This is especially true for when there are multiple
    different activities that need to have the same fragment; such a fragment might be a
    shared map of the user's location. These fragments can then talk to their parent
    activity by sending events to them via callbacks. Every fragment can specify an
    interface that their parent activities must implement. This allows the communication
    to flow in from fragment to activity.
    </p>
