        <h1>Getting started</h1>
        <p>Thankfully getting started with android is extremely easy and only involves downloading the toolkit and then creating a hello world app. </p>
        <h3>1.) Download Android Studio</h3>
        <p> Navigate to  <a href="http://developer.android.com/intl/ja/sdk/index.html">http://developer.android.com/intl/ja/sdk/index.html</a> and select "Download". The download should be ~ 1 gig.</p>
        <h3>2.) Install Java JDK</h3>
        <p> Next if you don't have it already you need to get Java. Android studio requires the Java JDK because the editor is built on top of the JVM. If you do not have java installed, it can be downloaded from: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html</a>. If you already have java, skip this step. </p>
        <h3>3.) Run the installer</h3>
        <p>Running the installer and installing all the defaults will add ~4 gigs, but all components are suggested as they include the SDK, Virtual Device, etc.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Create your project</h3>
        <p>Once installed, run Android Studio, and select "Start a new Android Studio project" from the Quick Start menu. By simply selecting an android phone app, naming it, and leaving the defaults, you will get the skeleton of a simple app created for you. This is all it takes to have your first running android app. Of course throughout the rest of the tutorial we will talk about how to make more advance apps but this at least provides a simple framework for you to work in.</p>
        
        <h3>Errors</h3>
        <p>Some people may encounter compile errors at this point when trying to run the empty shell. Many of these errors occur because your development environment is missing key pieces for the target device. Open up the plugin manager and you can download the files needed for different devices, Android OS's, and all the different android API's that you need.</p>
