        <h3>Installing Android Studio</h3>
        <p>Josh can you do this cuz I have no idea how to install it anymore</p>
        
        <h3>Android Framework</h3>
        <p>Android is an event based framework that queues up events similar to other event frameworks. Android provides call backs for these different events allowing different objects to be notified when certain events occure. Android apps are native apps and thus are tied very closley with the android operating system. The operating system gets events such as touches, networking data received, as well as communication from other processes and queues them up for the app to process. </p>
        
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>Android is built around the concept of a context. A context is a way to represent the current application environment. We will talk a little more about these later but the important part is to understand what they are. Essentially, anytime the app needs to interact with the environment, things like the filesystem or screen, then you need a context in which to interact. The root context is the application context which is heald by the application singleton. However each activity and service also holds on the context as well.</p>
