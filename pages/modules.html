        <h1>Modules</h1>

        <h3>What are Node Modules?</h3>
        Modules in Node are exactly the same as modules in other languages. It allows
        you to import functionality from other parts of the program. It allows the
        programmer to more effectively break up program code into multiple different
        file, each exporting similar functionality.</p>

        <p>We have already been writing modules and you may not have even known it!
        The Hello World program we showed in the introduction was a module. In fact,
        all code exists in a module. However, that is only a small part of the utility
        of a module.</p>

        <p>In the past couple of topics we have introduced you to a few modules,
        most notably the express module. While NodeJS modules are functionally equivalent
        to their analogs in other languages (such as packages in Java and #include's in
        C and modules in Python), they have a significant implementation difference that
        our team has found to be quite clever and beautiful.
        </p>

        <p>JavaScript alone never was intended to be broken up into modules. Originally
        designed to be a light languages to script limited parts of a website, the designers
        felt that building in imports like those in other languages would be unnecessary
        and cumbersome.</p>

        <p>As JavaScript rose in popularity, people created different ways to bolt on
        module systems to the scripting language. Over time some sophisticated libraies
        began to form like JQuery among others. These libraries rely on the user to execute
        their JavaScript file and as a result the library would introduce a global object
        with all the attributes of that library.
        </p>

        <p>Now, let us look into how we can create our own modules in Node</p>


        <h3>Creating Your Own Modules</h3>

        <p>Modules in Node.js look different from modules in other languages. We saw how to use modules
        in some previous examples, but we did not see how to create a module. </p>

        <p>To create your own modules in NodeJS, you use a special object called the export object.
        This object allows for the programmer to export different attributes and functions from
        the module.</p>


        <p>Let us create a couple of Node.js modules and see how they interact with eachother.</p>

        <p>We can start with a very simple math module. For now all the math module will do is
        simply run a "hello, world" program.</p>

        <div class="example">
        <div class="name"><h1>math.js</h1></div>
        <div class="pre">
        <pre>
// math.js
console.log('Hello, World!');
        </pre>
        </div>
        </div>


        <p>Now we can have a simple main file</p>
        <div class="example">
        <div class="name"><h1>main.js</h1></div>
        <div class="pre">
        <pre>
// main.js
require("./math.js")
        </pre>
        </div>
        </div>


        <p>This simple module main class will import the beginning of our math module.
        It is important to note that like many other dynamic languages, node will
        actually execute the required module like a program. This causes the require
        statement in the main program to actually print "Hello, World!" to the screen.

        Notice that the require statement requires the './' in front of the name to indicate
        that we are requiring a file in the current directory. This is important; without
        that qualifier, Node will crash, unable to find the module.

        More important to note is that the require path is relative to the file that
        is being executed, not the directory the current shell is in.
        </p>


        <p>Our module right now is not very useful. All it does is print "Hello, World!"
        This is not particularly grand, so how do we create modules that are actually
        useful? The answer is with this magical object called "exports."</p>

        <p>Recall that what Node does is execute a file to import it. What the require function
        does is first create an empty object called "exports." Then, node executes the
        JavaScript file given. Finally, require will return that exports object.</p>

        <p>This method of implementing modular functionality may seem quite primitive. It
        is primitive, but that actually works in Node's favor. Modules from Node enjoy many
        benefits that other languages simply do not. For example, modules in Node are just
        objects and may be passed to functions as arguments. This is something that only
        a handful of languages can claim. Node goes beyond that still. This mechanism for
        creating modules make encapsulation wonderfully easy to implement. This is a huge
        win for Node because it allows for better design by the makers of libraries.
        </p>

        <p>With this in mind, let's take a look at how to extend our math module to me
        a little more useful than just implementing the hello world program again</p>

        <div class="example">
        <div class="name"><h1>math.js</h1></div>
        <div class="pre">
        <pre>
// math.js
console.log('You are importing the math library!!!');

exports.PI = 3.1415927

exports.circleArea = function(radius) {
    return exports.PI * radius * radius;
}
        </pre>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
        <div class="name"><h1>main.js</h1></div>
        <div class="pre">
        <pre>
var math = require('./math.js')

console.log("pi: " + math.PI)
console.log("area(5): " + math.circleArea(5))
        </pre>
        </div>
        </div>

        <p>Recall that the exports object is actually the object we use and it is actually passed into us.</p>

        <p>Perhaps some believe this is verbose. After all, do you really have to put 'export.' in front of
        everything? Good news is no!</p>

        <p>There is another way to design modules in Node. When earlier I said that the require function created
        the exports object, that was only a half truth. The full truth is that this function actually create an
        object called 'module.' This module object contains an attribute called 'exports' which points to the same
        object as the global name!<p>

        <p>With how JavaScript works, we can directly set this attribute to something such
        as how the next code sample does it:</p>
        <div class="example">
        <div class="name"><h1>math.js</h1></div>
        <div class="pre">
        <pre>
console.log('You are importing the math library!!!');

var pi = 3.1415927

module.exports = {
    PI: pi,
    circleArea: function(radius) {
        return pi * radius * radius
    }
}
        </pre>
        </div>
        </div>


        <h3>The Module Object</h3>

        <p>
        I already stated previously that the exports attribute wasn't the only game
        in town, but what other stuff do modules have? Well, NodeJS is unique in that
        it encodes all information about modules as a part of the code of the module.
        The module object contains attributes such as its dependencies, whether it is
        loaded, its filename, and its name. This is a neat concept because it allows
        for dynamic introspection of modules themselves.
        </p>

        <h1>The Node Package Manager (npm)</h1>

        <p>
        Like many frameworks, NodeJS has its own package manager to facilitate the
        installation of commonly used packages. Npm is not only the package manager
        for Node, but all sorts of JavaScript frameworks. Npm has a couple of different
        ways to install packages. It can either install packages as local packages
        or as global packages.
        </p>

        <h3>Local Packages</h3>
        <p>
        If a package is installed as a local package, it is installed in a folder
        called node_modules. These packages will only be available to the current
        node project.
        </p>

        <p>
        There are several advantages to using local packages. The first is that
        it make dependency tracking a lot cleaner. In many cases, having global
        packages installed for different node projects can eventually lead to
        dependency conflicts. Another huge win for local packages is used when
        shipping a node application. If pushing the node application to a remote
        server, you won't have to worry about making sure the correct dependencies
        are installed because the dependencies are bundled with the application.
        </p>

        <h3>Global Packages</h3>
        <p>
        If a package is installed with the '-g' option, it is installed as a global
        package. This means all node applications will have access to this module.
        </p>
        <p>
        The main advantage with using a global package is that you only need to install
        the package once and you have it available for all projects. This is common
        for very commonly used packages like <i>express</i>. This does come as a cost;
        however, because to install a package globally on UNIX-like systems requires
        root access, while installing packages locally does not.
        </p>

        <h2>Next Chapters</h2>
        In the following chapters, we will cover some of the more important modules in
        NodeJS. All of the modules can be installed through the Node Package Manager.
