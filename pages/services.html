        <h1>Services</h1>
        <p>Services are another integral piece of Android development. As we dive into services, you will see some similarity between them, and the aformentioned activities. However, a service, unlike an activity, does not interact directly with the user. Therefore, there is no GUI component to it. These are instead, powerful background processes. A major benefit, and differentiator from activities are that services run at a higher priority than inactive or invisible activities. This means that it is less likely the Android system will ever terminate them for resource management. For perspective, common use-cases for services are long-running background tasks such as GPS, music streaming, notification triggering, etc. 
        </p>
        <h3>States of a Service</h3>
        <p>A service can exist in two different states, started(unbounded), or bounded. 
        <h4>Started</h4>
        A started, or unbound, service is the state of a service when it has been created by some application component, but does not yet have an application component bound to it. At this point, it is simply running indefinitely in the background. Furthemore, it is not linked to the component that created it, so even if that component is destroyed, the service will remain. In your code, <code>startService()</code> method call will "start" a service. 
        <h4>Bound</h4>
        After a service has been started, it can be bound to an application component. This client/server connection allows for the bound component to communicate with the service, and is initiliazed using the <code>bindService()</code> method call. 
        <h3>Creating a Service</h3>
        <p>Remember that, when adding something like a service, we will need to first update our Manifest to include a reference to our service in the App Manifest. We will call our service ExampleService. 

<pre></code>
&ltapplication&gt
    ...
    &ltservice
            android:name=".ExampleService"
            android:enabled="true" /&gt
&lt/application&gt
</pre></code>

<p> Now we can go ahead and create the java code for our service. Consider the significant methods, <code>onStartCommand()</code> and <code>onBind()</code> which directly relate to initiating the various service states. </p>

<pre><code>
public class ExampleService extends Service 
{
    // Passed back to indicate the mode a service starts in, and how to behave when it's killed. 
    int mStartMode;

    // This object receives interactions from clients. 
    IBinder mBinder = new LocalBinder(); 

    // Called when the service is being created.    
    public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    }

    // Called when the service is being started, using the startService() method.
    @Override
    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
        Log.i("Service started!");
        // Do stuff here
        return mStartMode;
    }

    // Called when a client binds to the service, using the bindService() method.
    @Override
    public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {
        return mBinder; 
    }

    // Extension of binder 
    public class LocalBinder extends Binder {
      public ExampleService getExampleServiceInstance() {
       return ExampleService.this;
      }
     }

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        Log.i("Service is shutting down");
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        ... 
    }
}

    ... 
}
</pre></code>

<p>Notice that we also create the mBinder object in this class, which will allow for binding to this service. In order to make things easier, we actually extend the binder class to create LocalBinder, which provides us an easy getter for the service instance. <code>DoSomething()</code> is a public method that we can imagine our activity wanting access to, once it's boundt o the service. </p>
<br>
<p> The corresponding code to start or bind to your service will most likely show up in an activity. Consider the following example. </p>
<pre><code>
public class ExampleActivity extends Activity {

    boolean mBounded = false; 
    ExampleService exampleServ; 

    ... 

    public void CreateUnboundedService() {
        // Create the intent that will specify which service to start. 
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, ExampleService.class); 

        // Starts the service (Unbound)
        startService(intent);
    }

    public void CreateBoundedService() {
        // Create the intent that will specify which service to start. 
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, ExampleService.class); 

        // Starts the service (Bound)
        bindService(intent, mConnection, BIND_AUTO_CREATE);

        // We now have access to public methods of service bound to. 
        exampleServ.doSomething(); 
    }


    ServiceConnection mConnection = new ServiceConnection() {
  
      public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName name) {
       mBounded = false;
       exampleServ = null;
      }
      
      public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName name, IBinder service) {
       mBounded = true;
       LocalBinder mLocalBinder = (LocalBinder)service;
       exampleServ = mLocalBinder.getExampleServiceInstance();
      }
     };
}
</pre></code>
<p> The code above has a few very critical components. First, the <code>CreateUnboundService()</code> method demonstrates how to simply use an intent to start a service. In our case, our intent specifies the "ExampleService" so, when passed that intent, <code>startService()</code> spins up a new ExampleService. However, if we want to be bound to that service, so that we have access to it's public methods, things get slightly more complex. Consider the <code>CreateBoundedService()</code> method. This method, again, creates an intent, but this time uses <code>bindService()</code> method to start the service. This not only starts the service, but also binds to it. In order to bind to the service, we must pass additional parameters, including a ServiceConnection and an integer flag for binding setting. However, in order to do this, we also had to implement an instance of ServiceConnection, which we call mConnection. Two methods, <code>onServiceConnected()</code> and <code>onServiceDisconnected()</code> must be implemented as well. <code>onServiceConnected()</code> gets us an instance of the iBinder, which we can simply cast to a LocalBinder. Using this binder, we can actually get a reference to our original server, which we call "exampleServ". Now all public methods of the service can be called using this object, such as <code>doSomething()</code>. <code>onServiceDisconnected()</code> must also be implemented in order to remove our reference to this object, and update the mBounded flag appropriately. </p>
<br>
<p> Although it is possible to obtain a reference to a service without using binding, this is the preferred method. A little more overhead is required up front, but this method allows for inter-process communication between applications. Essentially, an application from one app could bind to a service from another! Through services, we see some of the true power of android development. </p>
