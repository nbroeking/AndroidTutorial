        <h1>Services</h1>
        <p>Services are another integral piece of Android development. As we dive into services, you will see some similarity between them, and the aformentioned activities. However, a service, unlike an activity, does not interact directly with the user. Therefore, there is no GUI component to it. These are instead, powerful background processes. A major benefit, and differentiator from activities are that services run at a higher priority than inactive or invisible activities. This means that it is less likely the Android system will ever terminate them for resource management. For perspective, common use-cases for services are long-running background tasks such as GPS, music streaming, notification triggering, etc. 
        </p>
        <h3>States of a Service</h3>
        <p>A service can exist in two different states, started(unbounded), or bounded. 
        <h4>Started</h4>
        A started, or unbound service, is the state of a service when it has been created by some application component, but does not yet have an application component bound to it. At this point, it is simply running indefinitely in the background. Furthemore, it is not linked to the component that created it, so even if that component is destroyed, the service will remain. In your code, <code>startService()</code> method call will "start" a service. 
        <h4>Bound</h4>
        After a service has been started, it can be bound to an application component. This connection allows for the bound component to communicate with the service, and is initiliazed using the <code>bindService()</code> method call. 
        <h3>Creating a Service</h3>
        <p> The below code will create a simple service. Remember that, when adding something like a service, we will need to update our Manifest to include a reference to our service in the App Manifest. 
<pre><code>
public class ExampleService extends Service 
{
    // Passed back to indicate the mode a service starts in. 
    int mStartMode;

    // Called when the service is being created.    
    public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    }

    // Called when the service is being started, using the startService() method.
    @Override
    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
    return mStartMode;
    }

    // Called when a client binds to the service, using the bindService() method.
    @Override
    public IBinder onBind() {
    super.onCreate();
    }
}
</pre></code>
